Census (Census): https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/geographic-comparison-tables/
● US_65andOver.csv, US_HealthInsurance.csv, US_HealthcareForce.cvs, US_Poverty.csv, US_Poverty65andOver.csv
COVID (JHU): https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us 
● Csse_covid_19_daily_reports_us.csv (by dates)

Background:
● The COVID-19 response has differed greatly between states
● Large datasets offer a good exercise for BigQuery and Google Cloud
Console Research Questions:
● Are certain states at higher risk than others for adverse COVID-19 outcomes?
● Does the outcomes data suggest that these risks are playing a significant role?
 
Results paint a complicated picture
● Certain effects only appear below key thresholds
● Growth in knowledge between outbreaks obscures mortality rate Key Accomplishments:
● Found a potential critical threshold of healthcare worker proportion and identified states that may need more workers
● Identified states to track for the rest of the pandemic period to understand value of health investment
